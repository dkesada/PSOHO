# PSOHO

This package implements the particle swarm optimization structure learning algorithm for higher-order dynamic Bayesian networks from Santos and Maciel (https://doi.org/10.1109/BRC.2014.6880957). It will start off as an independent module and most likely will be incorporated into the 'dbnR' package. My objective is to provide the 'dbnR' package with some state-of-the-art methods of DBN structure learning, both for comparison with new methods and to give the current DBN scene richer alternatives than the usual "pick a static structure learning algorithm and run it twice: one to build the static structure and one to build the transition structure".

On a personal note, this repository will also serve me as a first serious approach to PSO and to R6 objects, both of which I've been meaning to invest some time in for a while now. 

## Some preliminary results

* Roxygen's interaction with R6 objects is kind of wonky. It kind of works, but at the same time it kind of doesn't. You can document R6 objects, but when you are bulding the documentation of the classes and their methods it showers you with warnings. Afterwards, you get the tooltips for the constructor of the class and the methods all mixed up, and when you are calling a method from an instantiated object you get no helping tooltip at all.

* Incorporating Rcpp inside R6 objects is as straightforward as it looks. No problems in that regard.

* You can call R code from within C++, and you can do some interesting stuff by calling and creating R6 objects from C++, although it's kind of weird:

```{Rcpp creating R6 objects, eval = FALSE}
Rcpp::List init_list_cpp(Rcpp::StringVector nodes, unsigned int size, unsigned int n_inds){
  Rcpp::List res (n_inds);
  Environment psoho("package:psoho");
  Environment env = psoho["Position"];
  Function new_ps = env["new"];
  
  for(unsigned int i = 0; i < n_inds; i++){
    Environment ps;
    ps = new_ps(NULL, size, nodes);
    res[i] = ps;
  }
  
  return res;
}
```

The previous function initializes a list of Positions, an R6 object, from within C++. The main idea is that R6 objects are essentially environments, and so you can import the function to create them from your package and then call it. This was cool, not gonna lie.

* Given that I have specific operators for Positions and Velocities and my search space is not continuous, I can't use packages like 'pso' for the particle swarm main functionallity.

* I've finished the Position and Velocity objects and operations, so I'll implement the pso algorithm and some parallelism with 'RcppThread' and maybe 'doParallel'. As an early note, combining 'doParallel' with the first particles initialization results in awful performance, maybe due to combining the results with the 'c' operator.
