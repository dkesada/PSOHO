# PSOHO

This package implements the particle swarm optimization structure
learning algorithm for higher-order dynamic Bayesian networks from
Santos and Maciel (<https://doi.org/10.1109/BRC.2014.6880957>). It will
start off as an independent module and most likely will be incorporated
into the ‘dbnR’ package. My objective is to provide the ‘dbnR’ package
with some state-of-the-art methods of DBN structure learning, both for
comparison with new methods and to give the current DBN scene richer
alternatives than the usual “pick a static structure learning algorithm
and run it twice: one to build the static structure and one to build the
transition structure”.

On a personal note, this repository will also serve me as a first
serious approach to PSO and to R6 objects, both of which I’ve been
meaning to invest some time in for a while now.
